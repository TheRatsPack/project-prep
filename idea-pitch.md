# IDEAS

## Summary
Snake Game
- using else loop to make the snake grow when it hits a white dot and trigger 'game over' if it hits itself or one of the walls
- Snake keeps moving one pixel at a time. use arrow keys to change its' direction
- using the x and y coordinates to keep track of and move the snake array
- box/div for coordinates and code in arrow key presses in each direction
- possibly use chart.js somehow?
- might need concepts we haven't learned yet. which is kind of ok as a stretch goal if we don't use a library we don't know

### Choose Your Own Adventure
- Text based story where you select an option or type commands to do things
- could type 'move forward' so a game without many visuals
- div box with animation
- can have user enter their name and implement it in the story

Dice Game(like yahtzee)
- use randomizer for 1-6 when rolling dice and attach animations and images
- constructor function to push the numbers where they should be
- score calculator

App to sign up for pet daycare
- use forms for information on them and when they will go
- about us/staff page

Calculator with a purpose to calculate numbers from specified things together
-can use text boxes for user to input values
-it would know which values to subract, add, or multiply

Poker/Card Game
-Depends on if we can make a game within our scope
-War, Go Fish
-Would require each player to be on a separate computer. Index would have them enter 'Player1' or Player2'
  -Would then send them to another HTML page showing their cards and center cards but not the other player


### Card Game 'War'
- have an array of 1-10 and face cards, or have an array with all 52 cards.
- have img folder with 52 images of the different cards
- have image of top of deck. players take turn flipping cards to see who has the higher card. a click will activate their deck like a button. whoever wins gets the lower card added to their array of cards.
- figure out how to have spades, clubs, hearts, and diamonds




## Problem or pain point thats solved
  Our app will be a solution for boredom. Entertainment. This goes for both games.

## minimum work required for demo day. Think MVP

- Working home page/preface
- Demo version of the game/short story. maybe leave off at a cliffhanger so they play the game
- have player enter a player name
- div boxes to make 'buttons' for each proposed choice
- a page for each choice picked or one page that continues to change per decision. just like the project where when you press the button and the graph appears. 
- implement a score system for certain decisions to win or lose
- have a final score page and persist the score player to player
